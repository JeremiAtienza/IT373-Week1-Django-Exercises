# Week 1 Django Activity -- Reflection

This week, I successfully completed the initial setup of a Django
project for our IT373 activity. I started by creating a virtual
environment and installing Django, making sure I had a clean and
organized workspace. After that, I created a project named `config` and
confirmed that everything worked by running the development server and
checking the default Django page.

Next, I built an app called `core` and added it to `INSTALLED_APPS`.
Inside this app, I created a simple view that displayed the message
"Hello, EVSU!" and connected it to the root URL. This gave me a better
understanding of how views and URL routing work together. I also set up
templates, including `base.html` and `home.html`, to practice template
inheritance, and I made an About page that showed my student ID and
name.

Along the way, I ran into issues with organizing template folders and
forgetting to register the app. Fixing those mistakes helped me improve
my problem-solving skills. Overall, I gained a deeper understanding of
Django's MVT structure, the value of clean code, and the importance of
using Git and GitHub for version control.
